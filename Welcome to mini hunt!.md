#  Let the hunt begin!

Notes (not a puzzle): üå∂Ô∏è (inspired by [Curious
Cookoff](https://curiouscookoff.com)) are ratings based mostly on puzzle length
and somewhat on difficulty. Internet searches are allowed (and needed). Feeling
stuck? If you feel excessively frustrated still on Sunday, email us at
mutedpuzzles at gmail with subject line HINT REQUEST for ["puzzle name"] ["your
username"], e.g.  HINT REQUEST FOR [BAGUS] [nrobot]. (After 8am Sun) we'll try
to respond within an hour. Happy puzzling!

# Some Random Poetry üå∂Ô∏è
_Well, that's what you would expect of new writers..._

With cases at highs as never before, 2021 started dim,   
But here's what I wrote, a hunt full of puzzles, on a wh\_\_\_.   
I picked up new hobbies, in a quarantine clich√©,   
Watercolored some flowers, and even tried to croch\_\_\_.    
I play with my cat, to try to restore, what's left of my mental energy,   
Lest I lie all day and all night, on my bed in leth\_\_\_.   
Though it may seem, there isn't much reason to yell yay or hurray,   
But all of my friends, and family too, they're healthy and ok\_\_\_!   
And although, of jobs I have none, I try not to stew in dismay,   
At least I'll get my vaccine (in a few days) through publix \_\_\_ M\_\_\_.   


2020, what a year to live through.     
At movies, bars, and clubs, there‚Äôs no longer a \_\_\_.     
I used to commute from Alewife to Braintree,     
But now I work from home. I don‚Äôt need the \_\_\_.      
Going inside without masks, now considered a sin,     
Forget going to restaurants, you should only stay \_\_\_.     
New year and vaccines, I‚Äôll celebrate with Henny,     
I have hopes and dreams, do you have \_\_\_?     


Back aches, feel old \_\_\_d.   
Cup my hot mug, sip some \_\_\_.   
Breathe out, a big s\_\_\_.   
Writing these poems, what a toil and trouble,   
I will not write twice, that'd make my worries \_\_\_ ‚Äì  
This is the last poem we'll give \_\_\_, of that I'll make sure.   

THOU HE BALK "REMOVER"
