# Poetry 🌶️

THOU HE <u>BALK</u> "REMOVER"

2020 sucked I knew,  
<!--Clubs and bars I saw no <input type="text" size='5' class="poetry">.  -->
Clubs and bars I saw no \_\_\_.  
Real life friends I hardly see,   
No more cafe catchup \_\_\_.  
Inside no masks was a sin,  
Takeout replaced dining \_\_\_.   
New year spring brings outdoor botany,  
Also hope and vaccines for m\_\_\_.
